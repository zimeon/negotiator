Summary: 
    Proper Content Negotiation for Python
    
    The Negotiator is a library for decision making over Content Negotiation requests.
    It takes the standard HTTP Accept headers (Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Charset,
    Accept-Encoding) and rationalises them against the parameters acceptable by the
    server; it then makes a recommendation as to the appropriate response format.
    
    This version of the Negotiator also supports the SWORDv2 extensions to HTTP Accept
    in the form of Accept-Packaging.
